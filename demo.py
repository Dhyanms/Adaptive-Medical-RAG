# Diabetes Type 2 Treatment Guidelines

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Treatment typically involves lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and sometimes insulin therapy.

## First-line treatments:
- Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight loss)
- Metformin (biguanide) - Reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity

## Second-line treatments (add-ons to metformin):
- Sulfonylureas - Increase insulin secretion
- DPP-4 inhibitors - Increase incretin levels
- SGLT2 inhibitors - Reduce glucose reabsorption in kidneys
- GLP-1 receptor agonists - Increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon, slow gastric emptying
- Thiazolidinediones - Improve insulin sensitivity

## Insulin therapy:
- Usually reserved for when oral medications fail to achieve glycemic targets
- Basal insulin: Long-acting insulins like glargine, detemir
- Bolus insulin: Rapid-acting insulins like lispro, aspart

## Monitoring:
- HbA1c every 3-6 months
- Blood glucose self-monitoring
- Regular screening for complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)

# COVID-19 Treatment Overview

COVID-19 treatment approaches have evolved significantly since the beginning of the pandemic. Current strategies focus on severity-based management.

## Mild to moderate disease:
- Symptomatic treatment: antipyretics, analgesics, hydration
- Monoclonal antibodies for high-risk patients
- Antivirals (remdesivir, molnupiravir, Paxlovid) within 5 days of symptom onset for eligible patients

## Severe disease:
- Oxygen therapy
- Dexamethasone or other corticosteroids
- Remdesivir
- Immunomodulators (tocilizumab, baricitinib) in selected patients
- Anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis

## Prevention:
- Vaccination remains the most effective strategy
- Updated boosters targeting circulating variants
- Masking and social distancing in high-risk settings

# Hypertension Management

Hypertension, defined as blood pressure â‰¥130/80 mmHg, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Management includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches.

## Non-pharmacological interventions:
- DASH diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy)
- Sodium restriction (<2300 mg/day)
- Regular physical activity (150 minutes/week)
- Weight management
- Alcohol limitation
- Smoking cessation

## First-line medications:
- Thiazide diuretics
- ACE inhibitors
- Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
- Calcium channel blockers

## Treatment targets:
- General population: <130/80 mmHg
- Older adults (>65): individualized targets
- Comorbid conditions may alter targets

## Monitoring:
- Regular blood pressure measurements
- Assessment of medication adherence
- Monitoring for adverse effects
- Periodic laboratory evaluations
